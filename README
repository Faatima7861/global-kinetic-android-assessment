#Introduction/Test design
This is the android mobile automation project for UAMPMusicPlayerAPP.apk
Developed using : Selenium , Appium , Java 
Design : Page object model with page factories
Framework : TestNG 
IDE : Eclpise
Build : Maven 
Reporting : Extent report from Test NG 
Github Repo : https://github.com/Faatima7861/global-kinetic-android-assessment.git
Versions of software : refer to pom.xml file in project

#Get up and running locally 
1. Clone the project from gihub
2. Import into eclipse IDE 
3. Update project (Right click on pom.xml -> Maven -> Update Project) 
4. On Update being successful with successful downloading of dependencies you can run the project. 
5. Right click on testng.xml -> Run as -> TestNG Suite
NB : Ensure your machine is set up correctly for android mobile automation. 
It is best to follow an online tutorial on how to set up android studio, sdk, appium etc on your machine. 
Run appium-doctor in your terminal to check if everything is set up correctly. 
If the set up is not correct - this project will fail to run locally. 


#Potential errors that may occur : 
1. Not all appium dependencies are correctly installed on your machine. 
2. Run 'appium-doctor' in your terminal to view if all dependencies are satisfied.
3. Class paths not found. Try and update the project again. Check version of dependency it is complaining abaout. 
4. Cannot find adb - ensure android home is set. Check eclipse IDE project. Run -> Run configurations -> Environments 
   /Users/{user}/Library/Android/sdk must be added as ANDROID_HOME environment variable path. 
5. Environment paths for java may not be set correctly. 

#Reporting
After successful test execution, The ExtentReporterNG.java class will create a folder in your user directory. 
The Reports folder will contain an index.html file that you can open in your browser. If you are unable to find this 
search your laptop for a Reports folder. 
If a Reports folder is not created, manually create one and re-run the test suite locally. 
The index.html file will then be generated in that location. 
Example of test result location locally : file:///Users/faatima/eclipse-workspace/DemoWorkspace/global-kinetic-android/Reports/index.html

Helpful information : 
1. Appium server and a test emulator starts and stops programatically. 
2. Ensure that you configure a test emulator in android studio as well. 
3. App file location
